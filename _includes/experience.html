            <p>This project has been very important part of my coding life. I was an individual contributor to this project with help of an Application Architect. Once my Architect lead said "Try to sing group song alone". I took that as token of appreciation. We used Roslyn compiler platform as a service to develop this VS Extension. Apart from this i had one helper website created with the help of Orchard CMS. A database created in Mongo Server. A couple of REST Api's.</p>
